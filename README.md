WISECONDOR (WIthin-SamplE COpy Number aberration DetectOR):
===
Detect fetal trisomies and smaller CNV's in a maternal plasma sample using whole-genome data.



1. REQUIREMENTS
---

WISECONDOR was developed and tested using Python2.7. Using any other version may cause errors or faulty results. The working version is tested using SAMTOOLS on .bam files created by BWA. Original work was based on SOAP2 files, and any SOAP2 mapped input stream should work as well although it requires additional arguments when using consam.py

Using Ubuntu, this should obtain the required packages:

	sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-matplotlib python-biopython

For any other unix based system, if easy_install is installed, you should be able to install all of these using this command in a terminal:

	sudo easy_install numpy matplotlib biopython



2. PREPARING FOR TESTING
---

To start testing for aberrations, WISECONDOR needs to learn how genomic regions behave when compared to eachother. To do so, reference data should be prepared in the same way as the test sample data later on, using the same genomic reference, the same GC-correction, etc.

Settings we used for external tools:

	bwa aln -n 0 -k 0
	bwa samse -n -1
	picardtools sortsam SO=coordinate VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=LENIENT CREATE_INDEX=true
	samtools rmdup -s $INFILE - | samtools view - -q 1

To create a GC-count table for the genomic reference you use, use countgc.py:

	python countgc.py path/to/reference.fa ./ref/gccount

Applying the GC-correction should be done for any sample file you have.

	python ./gcc.py ./in/sample.pickle ./ref/gccount ./in/sample.gcc

Then, all reference files should be fed into the newref.py script. The current implementation used all samples in a single folder, so after applying all your corrections to your data, move the reference samples into a separate folder and start the reference-build script:

	python newref.py ./in/refs/ ./ref/reference



3. RUNNING TESTS
---

To improve your results you probably want to change a few parameters. Most of the values used in WISECONDOR can be altered using arguments. To find out what arguments can be passed into any script, try running it with -h as argument, for example:

	python test.py -h

To create plots, use the file created by test.py as input for plot.py. This script turns the prepared data into a visualization, which can be customized or replaced to accommodate for personal preferences without the need to make changes to the original algorithm.



4. PITFALLS
---

Do not use any of the example data for your own tests, if available. Every reference file, laboratory and sequencing machine has its own effect on how read depth per bin behaves. Any results obtained by combining files from different origins are unreliable.
